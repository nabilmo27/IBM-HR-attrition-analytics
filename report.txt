Key Causes of Attrition
Long Commuting Distance: Employees living farther from the workplace have higher attrition, indicating that commuting stress may impact job satisfaction.
Work-Life Balance: Poor work-life balance is a significant factor in attrition, with those reporting dissatisfaction in this area leaving at a higher rate.
Low Job Satisfaction: Lower job satisfaction levels correlate with higher attrition, suggesting that employees who feel undervalued or unsupported are more likely to leave.
High Attrition in Younger Employees: The 18-25 age group and entry-level positions show the highest turnover, indicating a need for better engagement and growth opportunities for younger staff.
Recommendations for Reducing Attrition
Implement Flexible Work Policies: Offering remote or hybrid work options could help reduce attrition for employees facing long commutes, particularly those living over 15 km from the workplace.

Enhance Work-Life Balance: Introduce programs to support a better work-life balance, such as flexible hours, wellness initiatives, or workload adjustments, especially for employees with a “poor” work-life balance rating.

Focus on Career Development for Entry-Level Employees: Develop clear growth pathways, mentorship, and development opportunities for entry-level employees to increase engagement and reduce turnover.

Increase Job Satisfaction through Employee Feedback: Conduct regular engagement surveys and take action on feedback to improve job satisfaction, addressing issues like workplace environment, team dynamics, and management support.

Engage Younger Talent: Tailor retention programs to the needs of younger employees in the 18-25 age group, emphasizing career development, mentorship, and workplace flexibility to foster loyalty.

Strengthen Onboarding Programs: Given the high attrition among new employees, create an engaging and supportive onboarding experience to help them integrate smoothly and feel valued from the beginning.

By addressing these insights and implementing targeted retention strategies, IBM can foster a more supportive and stable work environment, reducing attrition and building a stronger, more loyal workforce.
